## VisualizaFEE: Data Visualization Platform of Economics and Statistics Foundation
This repository contains all the data, codes and supplemental materials of all the VisualizaFEE applications available at http://visualiza.fee.tche.br. This platform, written in Brazilian Portuguese, consists of several data visualization applications on various themes about Rio Grande do Sul (RS).

There are applications of crime related making use of criminal occurrences of the Secretariat of Public Security, data of demography of the Economics and Statistics Foundation and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, data of the index of socioeconomic development (idese) that represents a synthesis indicator of health, income and education, quarterly data of the Gross Domestic Product of RS and, finally, an application of the main macroeconomic data of Rio Grande do Sul regarding its Business Cycle.

The applications were all built in Shiny from RStudio and make use of the interactive graphics packages htmlwidgets (http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) such as plotly, leaflet, DT, D3plusR, D3plus and collapsibleTree.

## Consideration
All the applications were developed by me, except for IdeseVis which was developed by Luís Henrique Zanadrea Paese (https://github.com/paeselhz) with my collaboration.

In addition, MEG was developed with the collaboration of Luís Henrique Zanadrea Paese (https://github.com/paeselhz), Jéfferson Colombo and Fernando Cruz.
